# SbS Cortex Screen
A virtual GM screen, intended for Discord screen share.

Built with React & Tailwind v4. This isn't designed to be a full VTT, rather something showing key traits for players when needed + a map of the solar system. Character sheets and other miscellany are tracked elsewhere.

Built for *Swashbucklers by Starlight*, my TTRPG which has started as a kinda-sorta-Cortex-hack and will probably end as some strange abomination.

## Setup
This project requires Node v22 LTS or greater, with Corepack enabled â€” this should also install `pnpm` for you if you don't already have it.

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm i
```

## Commands
All commands are run from a terminal at the project root (here):
